1) Change the logmanager to a an object for every resurce manager.- it should accept the log file name as argument in constructor.
2) Change the receovery manger to use the logfile appropriately.
3) Resource manager constructor needs to accept the name of the logfile accoridingly.
4) TM should get the references of the resource managers.
5) TM should have its own log manager. The xid generation of the TM is dependent onthe logs.
6) Design logs for TM.==format , what operations to log.
7) TM needs routines like getStatusOfXid , and also setters of status of individual RMs. Like set RM1 status to "prepared " in TM.
8) Catch invalid, Aborted transaction in every routine , and invoke Wc.abort if any of the exceptions are thrown. Wc.abort should make a request for TM.abort , which will intrun invoke abort on the enlisted resource managers.
9) on Recovery :
	The Resource manager has to ,on receovery make a  list of 
	a)committed transactions : Redo them
	b) Aborted trasanctions : No prepare. So ignore them
	c) Incomplee trasnctions : Seen the prepared log ut dont know what to do- so query th TM , and move them either to committted or aborted. Then perform redo onluy for committed.
10) On recovery of TM :
	Check the scripts to see if they need to be recovred. Meaning if thee is a script which demands recovery of committed and aborted also , then recover them all.. Else recver only incomplete ones.
11) Reserveitenary : sooi , 
12) to handle tM crashes :
		maintain a list of the committed transactions : idempotence for aborted and committed.
